# AnonymousLetter

At AnonymousLetter the main idea is that you want to send a letter to someone, you donâ€™t have a printer and you donâ€™t want to write it yourself because you might be recognized by writing. The only thing that you can do is to collect newspapers, cut some letters out of the titles and store them somewhere. After you gathered some letters you can write a message and the program will tell you if you have enough letters to send it or not. If you have all the letters you can then press the 3rd option and send the message. Keep it anonymous! ðŸ˜Š
